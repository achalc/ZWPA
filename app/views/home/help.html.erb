ZWPA employees can easily enter information on a tablet, mobile phone, or computer both in the office and during client visits. Photos and notes can be added to the system through any device, and all files and information stored in the system can be easily accessed and retrieved both on-site and at the office. Metrics from the data collection process are stored in the database and can be exported to Excel for reporting.
